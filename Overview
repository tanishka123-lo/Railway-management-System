A Railway Management System (RMS) is a software application designed to automate and streamline the operations of railways, such as ticket booking, train scheduling, passenger management, and route tracking.
It helps railway authorities manage their services efficiently while reducing manual work and errors. The system allows passengers to register, book or cancel tickets, check train schedules, and make online payments
easily. Administrators can manage train details, routes,
staff, and generate reports on revenue or train occupancy. The main objective of the system is to provide a faster, safer, and more convenient way to handle railway operations and enhance passenger satisfaction.
